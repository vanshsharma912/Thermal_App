App for determining the appropriate thickness and U value for walling 

Insulation in buildings is an important factor to achieve thermal comfort for its occupants for cold winters and warm summers in a composite climate. Insulation reduces unwanted heat loss or gain and decreases the energy demands of heating and cooling systems. The thermal insulation in walls and roofs not only contributes in reducing the required air-conditioning system size but also in reducing the annual energy cost in buildings.
